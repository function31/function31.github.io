# Today I'm going to show you how to make a basic express server application.

### For this to work, both node and npm must be installed on your machine.

#### Now, lets begin.

1) Open your terminal. Now create a new project folder and cd into it.

  ```
  / > mkdir folder-name && cd folder-name
  ```

2) Create a package.json file with the defalt settings using npm.

  ```
  /folder-name > npm init
  ```

3) Install express along with all other node modules.

  ```
  /folder-name > npm install express -S
  ```

4) Create an index.js file in your project folder. Notice that this corresponds to the "main" value in your package.json file.

  ```
  /folder-name > touch index.js
  ```

5) Open your app.js file in a text editor. On the first line of the file, you're going to need to bring in the express module.

  ```
  const express = require('express');
  ```

6) Create the app itself.

  ```
  const app = express();
  ```

7) Next, specify the port you would like your app to run on.

  ```
  const port = 3000;
  ```

8) Now, you are going to set up your app to handle a basic GET request to your app.

  ```
  app.get("/", function(request, response, next) {
    response.send("This is an app running on an express server.");
  });
  ```

9) Tell your app to listen on the port you specified.

  ```
  app.listen(port);
  ```

10) Finally, go back to your terminal and start up your app!

  ```
  /folder-name > nodemon
  ```

11) Test that your app is running. Open a browser and go to (make a GET request to) http://localhost:3000. In your browser window you should see the response: ```This is an app running on an express server.```

### Congrats you have now setup a basic express server application.

## Here are ALL of the commands in order.

#### In your terminal:
```
/ > mkdir folder-name && cd folder-name
/folder-name > npm init
/folder-name > npm install express -S
/folder-name > touch index.js
```
#### In your index.js:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
app.get("/", function(request, response, next) {
  response.send("This is an app running on an express server."); });
app.listen(port);
```
#### Back in your terminal:
```
/folder-name > nodemon
```
